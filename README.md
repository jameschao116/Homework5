Paragraph of Data Normalization Problem
A data normalization problem that I think would come up with Netflix would be its movie suggestions to its members. Using a rating scale to help narrow its suggestions but also using the data from what the user chooses to watch to offer suggestions for movies to watch. With this amount of data they would have to use data normalization to keep it from being redundant. Also this would help quickly identify common themes around a location which could also add more to the data normalization giving a more specific suggestion range.
